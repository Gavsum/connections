# Stuff to test
# make a bunch of people using endpoints or factories(probably factories)
# make a bunch of connections of varying types: friends, co-workers, mutuals
# Check that the mutuals created match the number of mutuals returned by the end point
# Check that the mutuals returned by the end point are the true mutuals created
# Check that the mutuals returned are actualy mutual friends

# Error cases
# Try mutual friends of non-existant source person
# Mutual friends of non-existant target person
# Malformed requests:
#   Missing fields
#   Invalid fields
